 * @brief     Per-(generator, pollutant) capture & cost (CCS) declaration

 *
 * `EmissionCapture` is the data row that describes a Carbon Capture &
 * Storage (CCS) — or, more generally, any abatement-technology —
 * fraction installed on a specific `Generator` for a specific
 * `Emission` pollutant.  It lives **inline** on
 * `Generator.emission_captures[]`; there is no top-level
 * `emission_capture_array` because the capture is intrinsically tied to the
 * generator it lives on (CCS technology is a property of the unit, not of the
 * network).
 *
 * ## Semantics
 *
 * Given an `EmissionSource` row `src` with rate `r` and (optional)
 * upstream rate `r_u`, the matching capture row `cap` with rate
 * `c ∈ [0, 1]` causes:
 *
 *   - **net emission into zone balance**:
 *       (1 − c) · (r + r_u) · gen · dur          [tons of pollutant]
 *
 *   - **capture cost adder** on the generator dispatch column:
 *       c · (r + r_u) · cap.cost · dur · prob · disc / scale_obj
 *     (added per (scen, stg, blk) — same `CostHelper::block_ecost`
 *     chain as fuel cost and emission price).
 *
 * In the special case `c = 0` the row is inert (matches the no-CCS
 * baseline).  In `c = 1` everything is captured (no contribution to
 * the cap row) but the full capture cost is paid.
 *
 * ## Naming alignment
 *
 * | Property                | gtopt        | PLEXOS                |
 * |-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
 * | Capture fraction        | `rate`       | `Capture Rate`        |
 * | $/captured-ton          | `cost`       | `Capture Cost`        |
 *
 * IPCC / GHG-Protocol refers to the same concept as "abatement
 * efficiency" (rate) and "abatement cost" (cost).
 *
 * @see Generator.emission_captures[] for the inline list field
 * @see EmissionSource — the source row whose rate is scaled by
 *      `(1 − capture_rate)`
