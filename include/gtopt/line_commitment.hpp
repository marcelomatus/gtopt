 * @brief     Per-line Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) parameters
 * @date      2026-06-01
 * @author    marcelo

 *
 * Defines the LineCommitment structure which marks a transmission
 * Line as a switching candidate (Fisher-O'Neill-Ferris 2008 [1] OTS
 * decision variable: per-line ``u_l ∈ {0, 1}`` opens or closes the
 * circuit during the optimization).  Each LineCommitment entry links
 * to exactly one Line via a foreign key.
 *
 * OTS is strictly opt-in: the presence of a LineCommitment row makes
 * the referenced Line a switching candidate, absence keeps it pure
 * LP.  This sparsity discipline is critical — Fisher 2008 shows that
 * most savings come from a handful of lines [1], and even single-
 * stage 118-bus all-line OTS exceeds Gurobi's 1 h limit on ~half the
 * test instances at 0.01 % gap [2].
 *
 * LineCommitment constraints are only enforced on stages marked as
 * chronological.  On non-chronological stages (e.g. duration-weighted
 * representative blocks) the commitment is silently skipped and the
 * line behaves as if no LineCommitment row existed — matching the
 * convention of the existing ``Commitment`` element for generators
 * (see commitment.hpp:14).
 *
 * Method gate: OTS is rejected on the SDDP and cascade methods.  The
 * mathematical reason is in issue #509 §"Why monolithic only, not
 * SDDP" — Benders cuts on a mixed-integer subproblem are unsound
 * (Zou-Ahmed-Sun 2019).  The validation step in
 * ``validate_planning.cpp`` raises a structured error if any active
 * LineCommitment row coexists with ``method = sddp`` or ``cascade``.
 *

/**
 * @struct LineCommitment
 * @brief Marks a Line as an OTS switching candidate (issue #509)
 *
 * Links to a Line and exposes the binary status variable
 * ``u_l ∈ {0, 1}`` that the LP can flip to open or close the circuit.
 * The LP rows emitted by ``LineCommitmentLP`` (see ``line_commitment_lp.hpp``)
 * are:
 *
 *   1. Capacity gating (always emitted, both Kirchhoff and transport):
 *
 *        −F^max_ba · u_l ≤ f_l ≤ F^max_ab · u_l
 *
 *      so ``u_l = 0`` ⇒ ``f_l = 0`` (open circuit, no flow).
 *
 *   2. KVL big-M disjunction (Kirchhoff mode only):
 *
 *        f_l ≥ b_eff · Δθ_l − M_l · (1 − u_l)
 *        f_l ≤ b_eff · Δθ_l + M_l · (1 − u_l)
 *
 *      where ``M_l = |b_eff| · (θ_max − θ_min)`` (Fisher 2008
 *      baseline; iterative tightening per Pineda 2024 [3] is a v1
 *      follow-up that writes back to ``kvl_big_m``).
 *
 * Roadmap status (see issue #509):
 *   * v0   — capacity gating.
 *   * v0.5 — node_angle KVL big-M disjunction.
 *   * v1   — cycle_basis KVL big-M disjunction (both Kirchhoff modes
 *            now supported); per-line ``kvl_big_m`` override.
 *   * v1.1 — u/v/w three-binary decomposition with
 *            ``startup_cost`` / ``shutdown_cost``.
 *   * v1.2 — ``min_up_time`` / ``min_down_time`` anti-flicker rows,
 *            ``max_starts`` / ``min_starts`` / ``starts_scope``
 *            rolling-window cap (mirroring ``Commitment``).
 *
 * Deferred for v1.3+: PowerModels.jl IND+ indicator-constraint
 * alternative, iterative big-M tightening (Pineda 2024 [3] pre-solve
 * that writes back to ``kvl_big_m``), startup tiers.
