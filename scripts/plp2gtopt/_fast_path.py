"""Iterative SDDP fast-path defaults for the plp2gtopt pipeline.

Single home for the benchmarked PLP-faithful SDDP config so the two entry
points stay in lock-step:

* ``main.build_options``        — the CLI path
* ``GTOptWriter.process_options`` — the writer-direct path (a raw opts dict
  handed straight to ``convert_plp_case`` with no CLI)

The config (benchmarked to ~PLP parity on the CEN65 2-year case):

* ``model_options.lp_reduction``        — elide provably-zero LP columns (~-19% wall)
* ``sddp_options.aperture_solve_mode``  = ``warm`` (dual aperture warm-start)
* ``sddp_options.aperture_chunk_size``  = ``-1`` (all apertures/phase per chunk,
  one LP clone, warm-start reuse)
* forward/backward solver ``algorithm`` = ``dual`` (+ ``advanced_basis`` forward)

The bundled ``cplex.prm`` is retuned to dual / no-presolve to match (see
``plp2gtopt.install_solver_param_files``).

``cut_sharing_mode`` is intentionally NOT set here: the two callers target
different dicts — the CLI threads it through the top-level ``opts`` dict,
the writer sets it directly on ``sddp_options`` — so each owns that one line.

    """Apply the iterative SDDP fast-path defaults in place.

    Every field is a *default*: an explicit value already present in the
    target dicts (or seeded from the optional ``src_*`` planning dicts on
    the writer-direct path) wins. ``src_model`` / ``src_sddp`` are the
    source planning's ``model_options`` / ``sddp_options`` (empty on the
    CLI path, where there is nothing to inherit from).

    ``invariant`` selects the forward/backward LP algorithm:

    * ``False`` (default) — **dual simplex + warm-start** (``advanced_basis``
      on the forward).  Fastest, but the optimal *basis* is non-unique under
      LP degeneracy, so ``low_memory_mode`` off vs compress can land on
      different (equal-cost) vertices → non-reproducible per-cell LPs.

    * ``True`` — **barrier without crossover** (``crossover=False``).  Barrier
      converges to the unique analytic-center point and the cut path consumes
      that solve's unique interior duals directly (``crossover=False`` is the
      single knob — ``LinearInterface::ensure_duals`` does no lazy crossover),
      so off ≡ compress (bit-identical trajectories) regardless of how the LP
      is presented to the solver.  ``presolve`` is left at its default (ON):
      cold barrier re-factorizes from scratch every solve, so presolve
      shrinking the LP is pure benefit (unlike the dual+warm default, where
      presolve is disabled to preserve the warm basis).  Slower per solve and
      yields a different (equally valid) solution than the simplex vertex.
      Pair with the matching ``cplex.prm`` retune
      (``install_solver_param_files(..., invariant=True)``).
