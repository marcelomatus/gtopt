 * This module defines data structures for representing battery energy storage
 * systems in power system planning models. Batteries are modeled with
 * energy storage capabilities, efficiency parameters, and expansion options.
 *
 * @details Batteries in power systems provide services like energy arbitrage,
 * reserves, and grid support. This implementation models both operational
 * characteristics (state of charge limits, losses) and investment decisions
 * (expansion capacity).

 * @brief Represents a battery energy storage system in a power system
 * planning model
 *
 * @details This structure defines a complete battery entity with
 * identification, technical parameters, and economic attributes.
 *
 * A battery can charge (absorb energy) and discharge (deliver energy) within
 * its operational constraints. The state of charge is tracked between time
 * periods, accounting for efficiency losses.
