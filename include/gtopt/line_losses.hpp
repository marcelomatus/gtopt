 * @brief     Modular transmission line losses engine
 * @date      2026-04-03
 * @author    marcelo
 * @copyright BSD-3-Clause
 *
 * Provides a pluggable loss-model dispatch for transmission lines.
 * Each LineLossesMode has its own implementation function that adds
 * the appropriate variables and constraints to the LP.
 *
 * ### Supported modes
 *
 * Counts are PER LOSSY LINE, PER BLOCK — a mode's LP footprint is
 * `count × n_lossy_lines × n_blocks`.  (`K` = number of segments / tangents.)
 *
 * | Mode                  | Extra rows/block            | Extra cols/block |
 * |-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
 * | `none`                | 0                           | 1 (bidirectional
 * flow)    | | `linear`              | 0                           | 1–2 (flow
 * per dir)        | | `piecewise`           | 2                           | K+3
 * (segs + loss + fp+fn) | | `bidirectional`       | 4 | 2(K+2) (per-dir segs) |
 * | `piecewise_direct`    | 0                           | 2K  (per-dir segs
 * only)   | | `tangent_signed_flow` | K+1 (K tangents + 1 loss-upper envelope)
 * | 2 (signed flow + loss) | | `adaptive`            | resolved at config time
 * (piecewise/bidirectional) | | `dynamic`             | placeholder → piecewise
 * |
 *
 * `tangent_signed_flow` (Coffrin outer-approximation; `LinePwlLayout::tangent`)
 * is the plexos2gtopt DEFAULT (eps=0.1, K=6) and is BOTH the most compact (2
 * cols) AND the most accurate: its K tangent inequalities form a LOWER outer
 * envelope of `(R/V²)·f²`, exact at every tangent point, so it never
 * over-states loss.  Example footprint (10-05, 278 lossy lines × 168 blocks):
 * `tangent K=6` → 93,408 cols / 326,928 rows, vs the regressed
 * `piecewise uniform/midpoint K=2–5` mix → 284,088 cols / 93,408 rows.
 *
 * ### Mathematical background
 *
 * Quadratic loss: `P_loss = R · f² / V²`  [MW], with R [Ω], f [MW], V [kV].
 *
 * Piecewise-linear approximation with K segments over `[0, f_max]`:
 *   - Segment width: `w = f_max / K`
 *   - Segment k (1-based) loss coefficient: `loss_k = w · R · (2k−1) / V²`
 *   - Total: `loss = Σ_k loss_k · seg_k`, with `Σ_k seg_k = |f|`
 *
 * PWL layout (`LinePwlLayout`, line_enums.hpp) controls ACCURACY at fixed K:
 *   - `uniform`  — equal-width SECANT chords.  A chord is an UPPER bound of the
 *     convex quadratic: exact at the segment endpoints, over-stating between
 *     them, worst near `f = 0`.  On a lightly-loaded line (`f ≪ f_max`) with
 *     few segments the first chord (constant slope `R·w/V²`) sits far above the
 *     true `R·f²/V²`, over-stating loss by ≈ `w/f`.  Aggregated this is why the
 *     uniform mix booked 93.3 GWh of loss against only ~40 GWh that the flows
 *     physically support (10-05).
 *   - `midpoint` — each chord shifted to the segment midpoint → de-biased.
 *   - `tangent`  — Coffrin tangents: a LOWER outer envelope, exact at the
 *     tangent points, never over-states.  Preferred (and the intended default).

/**
 * @brief Add loss model variables and constraints for one block.
 *
 * Dispatches to the appropriate mode implementation:
 *   - `none`:             single bidirectional flow, no loss
 *   - `linear`:           directional flows with loss coefficients
 *   - `piecewise`:        shared segments for |f| = fp + fn [1]
 *   - `bidirectional`:    independent segments per direction [3]
 *   - `piecewise_direct`: PLP-faithful, per-segment bus stamps, no
 *                         loss var/row (requires no capacity column)
 *
 * @return LP indices for the created variables and constraints.
